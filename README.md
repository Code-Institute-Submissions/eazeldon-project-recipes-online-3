# Milestone project 3
Student at Code Institue  https://sugar-factroy-online.herokuapp.com/get_tasks

## Concept
This is a website for online recipes for all kinds of food from Sea food, chicken, meat to cakes and dessert.
The purpose of this site is to inspire the reader to cook delicious food and share their own recipes with other visitors.

## Website title
Why Sugar Factory? It is a play with words as the site is all about manufacturing sweet experiences.

## Design / UX Design

### Main userstory
The typical visitor is using a mobile phone to visit the site.
The main reason the visitor is using their mobile phone is for convenience. 
The visitor researches dishes on daily commutes, uses the site as shopping list when visiting the grocery store, and as a small footprint cook book while in the kitchen.
The main purpose is to get ideas for delicious dishes and instructions on how to cook them.
Secondary purpose is to share their own recipes and suggestions for dishes.

### Design
The website is designed with the intent to give the best possible viewing experience on mobile screens, followed by iPad screens and the lowest priority being laptop/desktop viewing.
The reason for this priority is that people to a growing extent use their mobile phones as the premiere viewing medium for sites especially to do quick research and also to have easy access while cooking in the kitchen.
The design is intended to be straight forward, simple to navigate and understand, without any confusing elements that can distract the visitor from finding and using recipes as well as finding and ordering appliances.

### Wireframe
I used balsamiq to design my wireframe. I used iPhone, iPad, and MacBook pro views to give myself an idea of what I wanted to achieve in terms of what the site visitors will see and how it should be displayed.
I’m aware of that when implementing it will not be perfect on all screens and operating systems but rather it will be a compromise.
My priority is iPhone as top priority, followed by iPad and then desktop/laptop experience.
I asked the tutor tab what is the best manner of attaching them to my project for the review. They told me to put all the wireframe files in a folder and upload the folder to my directory in cloud 9 and include it in the push to Heroku.

### Header background Image and other images
The image was carefully chosen as it supports the content on the site and it is intended to look inviting and appeal to the visitor, and thereby extend the amount of time spent on the site.
All other images were also carefully chosen to fit the theme and concept of the site and were found via Google

### Menu bar - top of page
Is in place to give easy access to the main pages of the site.

### Home page
Intent is to give the visitor a quick glimpse of the areas of content that can be found on the site and come across as appealing, interesting and inviting.

### Recipes page
This is a directory of recipes from which the reader can choose recipes for a wide variety of food
from Sea food, chicken, meat to cakes and desserts.

### Contact page
Designed to enable the visitor to contact the site admin as well as getting help in ordering products.

### Product page
This page features a number of useful products of high quality and functionality.
The page offers the visitor an opportunity to purchase the products as well. 
I recommend these appliances, because I'm using them myself.

### Post page
This page has been merged with the recipes page, to increase relevant interaction with the visitors and make it easier to the visitor to find the area where they can contribute.
The reader can contribute to the site by adding their comments and favorite recipes. 

### Colours
Colors were selected with the intent of being soft, soothing and inviting.

## Testing 
Testing has been made in Cloud 9, Inspect mode.
In addition, it has been live tested on MacBook Pro 15” screen, with MacOS ver. 10.14.6 and browsers Google Chrome and Safari, iPad mini with iOS ver. 12.4 using the Safari browser, iPhone 6 plus iOS 12.3.1 with safari browser. Test on iPhone 11 was cancelled due to Apple delivery issues of iPhone 11.
The live testing was done by visiting the deployed site. 
Testing result revealed that the site is not perfect on all screens but that was expected.
The site layout was designed with the intent to be as good as possible on mobile screens, followed by iPad and desktop viewing as the lowest priority.

## Technologies used
My code was inspired by practical python and data centric development.
The technologies used to build this project were:
html, css, javascript, Python, JQuery, Ginger

## Technical difficulties with css
Can't get the css to work properly, my coulors are not working.
I asked the tutor tab, my mentor and some friends in the programming industry for help. 
I tried the advice I received from to fix the filepath, I deleted the css and redid the css
and change it to css .my_class color: white; it works, but when I tried to change the other colors, its not working. 
Therefore, I put it back to white.

##  Deployment
I used Heroku and Github to deploy my  project using the following 3 steps. 
Step 1: I use git init, 
Step 2: git add . , 
Step 3: git  commit  -m”Finished my project 3” and a command git push origin master. 
Note, in Heroku in Step 3 I used: git  commit  -m "Initial commit" and a command git push origin master.
Technical issue with the deployment - I did not manage to deploy my changes and the tutor tab was not able to find a solution/reason to the issue.
The commands that didn't work were: git pull and git pull --allow-unrelated-histories.
But I managed to make the necessary changes to the code directly in GitHub to add my changes.
Please note there were no issues push to Heroku.
